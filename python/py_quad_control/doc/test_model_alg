1 - Instantiate figures
2 - Instantiate plant acoording to a specific model
3 - Set Prev values for state and reference
4 - Starting control signal set as 0.0
5 - Run for MAXSTEPS number of steps, from k=1 to k=MAXSTEPS:
5.1 - Get state (position and angles from plant)
5.2 - Get current reference
5.3 - Generate controller input vector consisting of error and error derivative
of the plant state in relation to the reference
5.4 - Store states for plotting
5.5 - Update Prev values for state and reference
5.6 - If k == 1 (First Iteration)
5.6.1 - Instantiate one controller for each degree of freedom (alt, pitch, roll,
yaw) with UMIN/UMAX, REFMIN/REFMAX, XSIZE, curr_x, curr_u
5.7 - Else
5.7.1 - Send curr_x, curr_y, curr_ref to the controllers and get output from
each one.
5.7.2 - Create array of control signals
5.7.3 - Convert control signals to motor speeds
5.7.4 - Update plant
5.8 - Plot results

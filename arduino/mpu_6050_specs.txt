------ Transfer Functions ------

- Accelerometer:

The Raw Value of the accelerometer is converted to acceleration throught
the following transfer function:

	Accel = Raw/F

Where F is given according to the configured sensitivity of the device,
given on the next table:

Configuration	Factor(F)	Unity
AFS_SEL = 0	16.384		LSB/g
AFS_SEL = 1	8.192		LSB/g
AFS_SEL = 2	4.096		LSB/g
AFS_SEL = 3	2.048		LSB/g

- Gyroscope

The Raw Value of the gyroscope is converted to  throught
the following transfer function:

	Angle_Rate = RAW/F

Where F is given according to the configured sensitivity of the device,
given on the next table:

Configuration	Factor(F)	Unity
FS_SEL = 0	131		LSB/(DEG/S)
FS_SEL = 1	65.5		LSB/(DEG/S)
FS_SEL = 2	32.8		LSB/(DEG/S)
FS_SEL = 3	16.4		LSB/(DEG/S)
